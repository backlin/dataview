Description: This package provides clear, informative and colorfull ways of
  presenting the contents of data.frame, list, environment etc. in the prompt.
  Ideally this package should be used in terminals supporting xterm 256 colour
  mode, e.g. the standard Ubuntu terminal. The Mac OS X terminal (as of Snow
  Leopard) only support ANSI colour, which still works but doesn't look as nice.
  On Windows systems no colouring is supported.
  If the output of functions like 'whos' is a mess or somehow doesn't look like
  it should check the help for the functions 'style' and 'style.mode' of the
  'xtermStyle' package.
