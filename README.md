dataview -- Human readable data presentation
========
This package will soon be replaced with a complete reimplementation, under the name of
[`synesthesia`](https://github.com/backlin/dataview/tree/develop).
I created `dataview` shortly after switching to R from MATLAB a couple of years ago,
and I have learned so much since then.

[`synesthesia`](https://github.com/backlin/dataview/tree/develop) is both faster, cleaner,
and is fully compatible with the brilliant [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) package.
